				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hustle, drive and the achieving of goals are what defines Reiterate. We have to admit to loving a fairy tale ending, and perhaps shedding a tear or two while we are at it! Passionate people going out on a limb and risking it all for what they believe in, gets us ticking. So, this week it has lead us to get a luxurious brow and lash lift package – for research purposes we promise!</p>
<p>We landed at ‘Bella Brows’, an up-market beauty salon situated in one of Brisbane’s most exclusive districts, Teneriffe. Who may be steering the ship? No other than Isabella Walker; a passionate, career driven 20-year old only a few years out of high school.</p>
<p>In only a short year, Isabella has grown her business from a solo home-based hobby to a booked-out, spacious Teneriffe studio with four staff working for her. We found ourselves curious to know more about this wonder-woman, and we were delighted to hear she had just opened a new business right next door, ‘Beaut. Space.’ &#8211; a beauty haven for makeup gurus to hire bays to run their own businesses out of, and think a glittery co-working space. This chick is unstoppable!</p>
<p>It is easy to assume ‘Bella Brows’ is like any typical beauty business in Brisbane, but boy we were left dumbfounded when we entered the Moroccan-style studio. Isabella’s mantra is, ‘the eye should be the focal point of your face, without overpowering your beautiful facial features.’</p>
<p>The point of difference is in the minor details, including those relaxing leather reclining chairs, and greenery that will make you feel like you are on that long-awaited tropical holiday. Above all, however, it is the skill of the staff that is most impressive. ‘Bella Brows’ is the first beauty salon in Queensland to be trained in the world-recognised YUMI LASHES Lash Enhancement, and their brow work is a form of art!</p>
<p>Isabella describes the process of business growth to be exciting and petrifying, all wrapped up in a neat little package: “I continue to take huge leaps every-day within my business. I have lots in the pipeline and find myself having to take a step back to focus on one project at a time. I believe if you have the passion, you just need a strong business structure to follow in order to be a success.”</p>
<p>It was clear to us the hard work is far from over at ‘Bella Brows’ and ‘Beaut. Space.’, with Isabella managing perfectly, despite having her hands full. With business running smoothly and boasting just under 2000 clients, the young entrepreneur is climbing faster in the business world than a moment’s blink.</p>
<p>Brisbane-ites, if you haven’t treated yourself to a brow sculpt or lash lift by Isabella at ‘Bella Brows’, then we highly suggest you hop to it (the artists book out months in advance). The experience alone is above any beauty treatment we have had, and now you have a behind the scenes insight, it will be even more exciting.</p>
