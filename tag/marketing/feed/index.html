				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>So you think you can ‘gram?</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Becoming an Instagram Influencer is to today what ‘making it big in Hollywood’ was to the ‘90s. It seems like the goal of every second person is to have tens of thousands of followers, get paid to promote brands, and achieve what we all crave &#8211; social media fame. Don’t get us wrong, the dream is an attractive one, but achieving ‘Instafame’ is easier said than done. Here are 7 tips to set you apart from the rest.</span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 1: Understand If It&#8217;s Really Worth Your While.</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s start with the cold, hard reality. Becoming an influencer is hard. Many of us think, ‘if I just do X, Y, and Z, I’ll be somebody. Just a few hundred more squats and I’ll be partying with Bella, Kendall and [insert famous Insta person here]’. The truth is, there’s only a low percentage chance that you’ll become a successful influencer, earning a consistent income. Ask yourself: how many people do I know have made it big on the ‘gram? The answer is probably one, maybe two, if any. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unless you’ve been <i>very</i> genetically gifted (or, if you’re the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elisha__h/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herbert twins</a>, genetically gifted <i>and</i> identical), it’s going to take a LOT of time before becoming influential. To most of us, becoming ‘Instafamous’ is going to be an improbable task. Do you know the percentage of actors that make it in Hollywood? Neither do we, but it’s probably infinitesimally small. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s not to say that it’s impossible. If God didn’t grace you with the looks of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madi_edwards/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madi Edwards</a>, or a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beauwhittington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beau Whittington</a>, it just means you’re going to have to work harder. I mean, if you’re 6’10” and from a basketballing family, you’re more likely to make it in the NBA than if you’re 5’9” and from a family of mathematicians (side note: 17% of <i>all male Americans </i>over 7’ play in the NBA).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most common reasons you hear people wanting to be an Instagram influencer is so they can “be paid to go to Bali and post photos.” Okay, that makes sense. That <i>would </i>be nice. But let’s break down that dream a little further.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting your Instagram to the point where you have enough followers, and a strong enough personal brand to be able to get a free holiday is going to take hundreds of hours. Literally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let&#8217;s say you spend 500 hours to get there. If you spend an hour a day on your personal Instagram &#8211; which isn’t unheard of &#8211; that’s 500 days. So say in about a year and a half, you become an influencer with a following that warrants a paid trip to Bali, flight and villa included. Nice! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But here’s the thing. If you earn just above minimum wage &#8211; say, $20 an hour after tax &#8211; after 500 hours of <i>not</i> working, you’ve ‘lost’ $10,000. You could have had 5 Bali holidays in the time you spent to get 1 paid trip (that isn’t guaranteed!)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Could your time be better spent invested elsewhere? What if you invested 500 hours into learning how to do great Facebook advertising, like us? What if you invested 500 hours into becoming an expert in something you&#8217;re interested in? Your return on investment is going to be a lot higher.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very likely that just like when you&#8217;re a kid playing Runescape for hours on end to get your woodcutting to level 75, you&#8217;ll realise that it was all time wasted.</p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 2: Be Honest With Yourself. </b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I&#8217;m 5ft 8&#8243; and average looking&#8230; I know that I&#8217;m not going to be Calvin Klein’s next runway sensation&#8230; And I&#8217;m okay with that. If you&#8217;ve never had a paid modelling gig, but you&#8217;re trying to make your way to Instagram fame as a &#8216;freelance model&#8217;, it&#8217;s highly likely you&#8217;re on the wrong track. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the hardest tip of them all and is the reason the majority of people fail&#8230; You have to be honest with your approach. With both yourself and with the content you post.  Your channel needs to be authentic. You need to know who you are, what you&#8217;re interested in, and what you believe in, to ever be successful on Instagram. Some people truly are Byron Bay models that spend their day at the beach collecting stones, making sandcastles and playing the guitar with friends. That&#8217;s a great story to tell.</span></p>
<p>If you live in Brisbane City, get to the beach every third weekend, don&#8217;t know how to surf and don&#8217;t really have a true interest in nature&#8230; Don&#8217;t try an emulate the aforementioned Byron Bay goddess by posting 15 photos of that one time you went to the beach. Authenticity is key.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">True, there is a lot of, shall we say ‘constructive representations’ on Instagram. Okay, a lot of people lie. But generally, the only people doing this are those that are insanely attractive, with follower bases centred on lust (or envy).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the rest of us, be honest. When you post “always thinking about tacos&#8221; with a picture of your Louis Vuitton bag, designer sunglasses, expensive jacket and your BMW steering wheel in-frame&#8230; we know you&#8217;re not thinking about tacos. You&#8217;re using that as an excuse to show off all your expensive shit. People aren&#8217;t dumb&#8230; don&#8217;t do that. Again, authenticity is key. </span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 3: Have a niche.</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following on from tip 2, unless you <i>are</i> genetically gifted, don&#8217;t run your channel as a &#8216;model&#8217;. Models are models because they&#8217;re in the top 1% of people who were graced at birth with good looks. Lucky them. But if you&#8217;re not a model, all isn&#8217;t lost! There are other ways to become an influencer. And honestly, being at the top of a niche audience with a few thousand followers can be more profitable than being a B-Grade model with tens of thousands. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The whole concept of being an influencer is that you can influence people (who would have thought right?). Take celebrity endorsement, one of the basic tenets of advertising, as an example. When people see George Clooney drink Nespresso, the default thought is ‘if it’s good enough for George, it’s good enough for me!’. It’s fundamental. It also positions the brand based on the existing status of that influencer and the relationship they have with their audience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It follows then, that even if your follower count isn’t in the hundreds of thousands, niche categories can still offer good returns, for example:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> • computer gamer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> • vegan chef</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> • toddler fashion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> • women&#8217;s golf</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> • Brazilian JuJitsu instructor </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may not be Australia&#8217;s ‘Next Instagram Top Model’, however, a few thousands of niche, highly engaged followers can be just as profitable.</span></p>
<p>In my case, I am setting up my personal brand as a digital marketer, because, well&#8230; that&#8217;s what I am. I like surfing, but I&#8217;m not a blonde haired semi-professional from Byron Bay. I like martial arts, but I&#8217;m not a UFC fighter. I like to stay fit and healthy, but I&#8217;m not a PT. Digital marketers don&#8217;t get hundreds of thousands of followers and don&#8217;t get paid to go to Bali. And that’s okay. I get paid for business clients. It only takes 1 person to discover my personal and business brand, and that may pay for me to get to Bali. It&#8217;s not always about the number of followers. No &#8216;Happy Humpday&#8221; posts required.</p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 4: Offer Value.</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People are cautious before tapping the follow button. Everyone is worried about that dreaded ‘following-to-follower ratio’, that so obviously defines your importance as a person. But, for this reason, <b>you have to offer <i>value</i></b><i>. </i>And that value needs to be tailored to your niche audience mentioned above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, if you&#8217;re a woman&#8217;s golf influencer, posting about your Saturday night out on the wines with the girls, while fun for you, may not be offering any value to your followers. They&#8217;re following you because they like women, in golf. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to be a travel blogger, then you need to actually, travel &#8211; blog. Travel blogging is far more than posting pretty pictures; it&#8217;s about helping people get the most out of their holidays. Unknown destinations, local only eateries, cultural sensitivities often forgotten etc. Owning a DSLR camera and going on a 3-week overseas vacation a year (or a one-time sabbatical), doesn&#8217;t make you a travel blogger any more than pulling out a splinter makes you a trauma surgeon.</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone that&#8217;s thrown away their desk job, speaks 5-languages and is touring around the world for 2-years surviving on $1 a day &#8211; document that shit! That&#8217;s a concept that will get traction because it offers <i>value</i>. It&#8217;s interesting. People want to know if it&#8217;s possible and see what that particular journey entails. They want to dream that, one day, they too can go travelling on $1 a day.</p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 5: Benchmark. </b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a common business term that holds direct relevance to our situation. Look at people who have been successful at what you want to do, and ‘benchmark’ (imitate) what they’ve done. Remember ‘good artists copy, great artists steal’ &#8211; Picasso. Study their profile, their trends, their themes. For example, it&#8217;s common for models to use applications that whiteout backgrounds, so that the subject pops. It essentially makes nearly every photo you post look like a modelling shoot. Not a bad plan of attack &#8211; on brand. If you&#8217;re a vegan chef, you may notice lots of close-ups of food, or perhaps, lots of shots of the chef cooking the food. Spot these trends and follow suit! </span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 6: Be Consistent. </b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is least thought about but absolutely vital. You need to be consistent with all that you do on Instagram; from how often you post, to what you post and how you caption. Being an influencer is about keeping everything ‘on brand’: your personal brand. If you don’t yet know what your personal brand is, refer to tips 2 &amp; 3.  </span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1" style="color: #f7ad48;"><b>Tip 7: Exposure. </b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro-tip: getting Instagram followers is a lot like getting people to purchase products. The same marketing funnel applies.</span></p>
<p><b>Awareness -&gt; Consideration -&gt; Conversion</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Firstly, you need to generate awareness. People need to know your profile exists. Have a public profile and use hashtags. Engage with profiles that have similar target audiences to yours. Use likes, but more importantly, comment. Commenting has a far higher click-through rate. Also, generate click-throughs to your page from other web-sources. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once people know about your page, they need to choose whether your page is worth letting that following-follower ratio slip, ever so slightly. That&#8217;s where all the points in this blog post come in. If you&#8217;ve followed the tips here, you&#8217;re in with a better chance. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hustle, drive and the achieving of goals are what defines Reiterate. We have to admit to loving a fairy tale ending, and perhaps shedding a tear or two while we are at it! Passionate people going out on a limb and risking it all for what they believe in, gets us ticking. So, this week it has lead us to get a luxurious brow and lash lift package – for research purposes we promise!</p>
<p>We landed at ‘Bella Brows’, an up-market beauty salon situated in one of Brisbane’s most exclusive districts, Teneriffe. Who may be steering the ship? No other than Isabella Walker; a passionate, career driven 20-year old only a few years out of high school.</p>
<p>In only a short year, Isabella has grown her business from a solo home-based hobby to a booked-out, spacious Teneriffe studio with four staff working for her. We found ourselves curious to know more about this wonder-woman, and we were delighted to hear she had just opened a new business right next door, ‘Beaut. Space.’ &#8211; a beauty haven for makeup gurus to hire bays to run their own businesses out of, and think a glittery co-working space. This chick is unstoppable!</p>
<p>It is easy to assume ‘Bella Brows’ is like any typical beauty business in Brisbane, but boy we were left dumbfounded when we entered the Moroccan-style studio. Isabella’s mantra is, ‘the eye should be the focal point of your face, without overpowering your beautiful facial features.’</p>
<p>The point of difference is in the minor details, including those relaxing leather reclining chairs, and greenery that will make you feel like you are on that long-awaited tropical holiday. Above all, however, it is the skill of the staff that is most impressive. ‘Bella Brows’ is the first beauty salon in Queensland to be trained in the world-recognised YUMI LASHES Lash Enhancement, and their brow work is a form of art!</p>
<p>Isabella describes the process of business growth to be exciting and petrifying, all wrapped up in a neat little package: “I continue to take huge leaps every-day within my business. I have lots in the pipeline and find myself having to take a step back to focus on one project at a time. I believe if you have the passion, you just need a strong business structure to follow in order to be a success.”</p>
<p>It was clear to us the hard work is far from over at ‘Bella Brows’ and ‘Beaut. Space.’, with Isabella managing perfectly, despite having her hands full. With business running smoothly and boasting just under 2000 clients, the young entrepreneur is climbing faster in the business world than a moment’s blink.</p>
<p>Brisbane-ites, if you haven’t treated yourself to a brow sculpt or lash lift by Isabella at ‘Bella Brows’, then we highly suggest you hop to it (the artists book out months in advance). The experience alone is above any beauty treatment we have had, and now you have a behind the scenes insight, it will be even more exciting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when I was working for the worlds third-largest advertising agency,<a href="http://www.publicis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Publicis Groupe, </a>I struck a conversation with the 2nd in charge of the Brisbane Agency, the Creative Director. I was working on my application for <a href="http://awardonline.com/education/award-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWARD School</a>, a highly sort after advertising school which is the primary way advertising creatives get a job as an Art Director. It&#8217;s hyper-competitive (hundreds apply, only a dozen or two get in), <em>so I knew to have any chance, I needed all the help I could get. </em></p>
<p>I asked him,<em>&#8220;what do you think the best book ever written on advertising is?&#8221;</em>. His response was simple, <em>&#8220;this one&#8221;.</em> He handed me a little blue book aptly named <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Blue-Book-Advertising-Difference/dp/1591841240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;The Little Blue Book Of Advertising &#8211; By Steve Lance &amp; Jeff Woll.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book that breaks down all the principles of effective advertising into 52 small ideas. It&#8217;s a book to this day, I read regularly to continually sharpen my advertising skills. To save you reading the whole thing, below are my favourite-5 takeouts:</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7ad48;">Read what your customer reads &#8211; watch what they watch.</span></h4>
<p>You need to tap into your ideal customer&#8217;s media habits. What are they watching? What are they reading? What are they doing on the internet? When you take this approach you can objectively see yours and your competitors ads in-situation. You can begin to understand if your advert stands out,  whether it&#8217;s clearly delivering your desired message or how it fairs in comparison to your competitors. It&#8217;s pivotal to put yourself in the mind of the consumer. Don&#8217;t just look at the pictures. Engage with the content the same way your customer would. Get in your customer&#8217;s mind so you can create and deliver adverts that truly connect with your target audience.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7ad48;">Quality is the absence of non-quality signals.</span></h4>
<p>This is a saying that has really stuck with me over the years. I&#8217;m a perfectionist by nature and as a marketer, this can lead me down a path of spending hours going over every single minute detail&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Should that heading perhaps be +1pt larger?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Should we reduce the line gap between the sections by 5%?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rounded corners or square corners on the buttons?&#8221;</p>
<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve learnt that this level of detail can be wasteful. The better approach is to simply put yourself in the consumer&#8217;s shoes&#8230; Ask yourself:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If I were a customer, is there anything here that would strike me as wrong or poor quality?&#8221;  </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Is the copy easy to understand?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Am I compelled to take action?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>If the answer to all these questions is yes, well then adjusting the heading font size by +1pt font size does not really matter that much. Quality is the absence of non-quality signals &#8211; not perfection.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7ad48;">People don&#8217;t care about your company or brand.</span></h4>
<p><em>&#8220;What! How could you say that? Our customers love us!&#8221;</em> I hear you declare&#8230; This is true, your current customers probably do love you&#8230; But your prospects don&#8217;t&#8230; yet.</p>
<p>The average person viewing your advert for the first time doesn&#8217;t know you from a bar of soap. &#8220;Buyers are selfish. They are selfish with their time, attention and power of memory. You need to satisfy them. You need to appeal to them and the beliefs they are interested in&#8221; (Woll &amp; Lance, 2006).</p>
<p>Take a look at your ads and see whether they are all about you, or about a benefit to the reader. Chances are the former rings true.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7ad48;">Sell the benefit, the advantage and then the features &#8211; in that order.</span></h4>
<p>It&#8217;s all too common for business owners and marketers to get excited about the features of their product/service. They can&#8217;t help but go on and on about all the wonderful things it can do. This leads them to neglect to focus on the most important thing &#8211; the benefit. And it is the benefit that leads people to buy.</p>
<p>Take for example my MacBook Pro computer&#8230; A feature is its 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.  An advantage is that it is 20% faster than the previous model processors. The benefit (and subsequently the headline <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple </a>use) &#8211; &#8220;Speed of the art&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple has brilliantly incorporated all these things into one concise 4-word sentence. We know it&#8217;s fast and we know it&#8217;s state of the art, but cleverly the benefit is also there, &#8220;creating &#8216;art&#8217; faster&#8221;. Knowing that one of Apple&#8217;s main target markets are designers/filmmakers/photographers &#8216;art&#8217; here, refers to their work. <em>Work faster, easier and create more art (and potentially money) &#8211; with an Apple MacBook Pro.</em> Apple&#8217;s marketing never fails. Hopefully one day they&#8217;ll be a Reiterate client?</p>
